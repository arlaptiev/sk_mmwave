EXPERIMENT 1.
Single box on the floor with the object

Radar-to-floor/table = 1m
Radar-to-topbox = 0.7m

SETUP 2
Box on top of the box
Radar-to-boxbtm = 1.2m
Radar-to-boxtop = 0.5m
33
68
120


Decrease the strength of the boxbtm surface to improve obj resolution?
- Use box-on-box setup

SETUP 3
Box on top of the large box

radar-to-boxtop = 0.77
radar-to-boxbtm = 1
radar-to-floor = 1.7
